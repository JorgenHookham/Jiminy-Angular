# Jiminy #
Keep track of moments that you want to reflect upon at the end of your day or your week. Jiminy lives in your pocket, helping you keep an eye on your character strengths and virtues.

The method is very simplistic, it's an honour system, and it's on the web. Jiminy has suggestions for you to select from for your list of virtues. When you notice something worth reflecting on, go to [jiminyapp.net](http://jiminyapp.net) and add a tally. When you sit down with Jiminy to review, you can see the day and time to inspire your recollection of each moment.
